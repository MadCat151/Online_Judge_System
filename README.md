# Online_Judge_System
Based on Spring Boot, Docker, Vue 3, and Arco Design, this system is an online coding evaluation platform. Admins can create/manage problems, and users can search, read, write, and submit code. The backend compiles, runs, and verifies code using a custom code sandbox, which can also serve as an independent service for developers.
